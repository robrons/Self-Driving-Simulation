# **Self Driving Car Simulation** 
### Purpose
* Develop a self-drving car model based on convolutional neural network. 
* Use Keras On top of Tensor Flow as our machine learning API. 
* Use two diffrent data inputs (Steering Angle and Car Camera). 
* Implement the enviournment as a simulation in Udacity's car simulator app. 
### Challenges
* Training the data takes large amout of time. (One solution would be to use Google Cloud Platform). 
### Expectation
* The car being able to drive itself with minimal crashes.
